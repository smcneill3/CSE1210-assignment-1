## Setting up a GitHub hosted web page
Follow these instructions to set up a GitHub hosted web page of your assignment.

1. Go to the Setting tab.
2. Scroll down to the __GitHub Pages__ heading (about half way down the page).
3. In the __Source__ pull down menu select __master branch__.
4. Click the __Launch automatic page generator__ button. 
5. On the next page (called New project site), scroll to the bottom and click on the green button __Continue to layouts__. Do not change any settings or text on this page.
6. On the next page, select a page template (any page template will do) and click on the green __Publish page__ button...
7. ... this will take you back to your repository landing page. Notice the link to your published web page on top of the page (in a light blue box). The URL for your web page will have the following format https://qehscs.github.io/CSE1210-assignment-1-Tony-Stark-CS/ where Tony-Stark-CS will be replaced with your GitHub user name.
8. Copy the web page URL 
9. Open up this README.md file for editing and paste in the URL on top of the page after the "My URL: " line. Commit the README.md file.

## Customizing the Webpage
Open up two tabs in your browser, navigate to your webpage in one of the tabs and to your assignment repository in the other tab. Open up the ```index.html``` file for editing (make sure you use __soft wrap__ in the GitHub code editor to have linebreaks) in your browser and customize your web page in the following ways:

1. Change the line __This project is maintained by QEHSCS__ by replacing QEHSCS with your name.

Before continuing find and look closely at the HTML markup in the ```index.html``` file where the text of web page is included.. In particular notice the opening and closing  tags that are used to format the text, in particular the ```<h3>``` and ```</h3>```, ```<p>``` and ```</p>``` and ```<a href="...">``` and ```</a>``` tags.

You will now replace the default web page text with your own information.

2. Select a country of your choice 
3. Replace the title of the web page with the name of the country. Note that the title of the web page appears both in the tab and on top of the page.
4. Set up the following headings: Capital, Official Languages, Population Size, Land Area in Square Kilometers, Currency. Follwing each heading include the necessary text providing the indicated information. For example, under the heading Capital provide the name of the capital city of the country.
5. At the bottom of the web page include the following text __See Wikipedia for more information__ with the text linking to the corresponding Wikipedia page for the country.
6. Bonus Challenge: Add a picture of the country's flag to your web page.  

Before turning in your assignment make sure that the web page is formatted properly and nicely. Spelling mistakes, typos and ugly formatting will all result in deductions.
